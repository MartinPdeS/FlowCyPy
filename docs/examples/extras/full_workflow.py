Simulating and Analyzing Flow Cytometer Signals
===============================================

This script simulates flow cytometer signals using the `FlowCytometer` class and analyzes the results using
the `PulseAnalyzer` class from the FlowCyPy library. The signals generated (forward scatter and side scatter)
provide insights into the physical properties of particles passing through the laser beam.

Workflow:
---------
1. Define a particle size distribution using `Scatterer`.
2. Simulate flow cytometer signals using `FlowCytometer`.
3. Analyze the forward scatter signal with `PulseAnalyzer` to extract features like peak height, width, and area.
4. Visualize the generated signals and display the extracted pulse features.

# Step 2: Define flow parameters
# ------------------------------
# Set the flow speed to 80 micrometers per second and a flow area of 1 square micrometer, with a total simulation time of 1 second.

# Step 3: Define the particle size distribution
# ---------------------------------------------
# Use a normal size distribution with a mean size of 200 nanometers and a standard deviation of 10 nanometers.
# This represents the population of scatterers (particles) that will interact with the laser source.
