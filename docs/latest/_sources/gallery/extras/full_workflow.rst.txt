WorkFlow
========

This script simulates flow cytometer signals using the `FlowCytometer` class and analyzes the results using
the `PulseAnalyzer` class from the FlowCyPy library. The signals generated (forward scatter and side scatter)
provide insights into the physical properties of particles passing through the laser beam.

Workflow:
---------
1. Define a particle size distribution using `ScattererCollection`.
2. Simulate flow cytometer signals using `FlowCytometer`.
3. Analyze the forward scatter signal with `PulseAnalyzer` to extract features like peak height, width, and area.
4. Visualize the generated signals and display the extracted pulse features.

Step 1: Import necessary modules from FlowCyPy

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 19-25

.. code-block:: Python

    from FlowCyPy import FlowCytometer, ScattererCollection, Detector, GaussianBeam, FlowCell
    from FlowCyPy import distribution
    from FlowCyPy.population import Population
    from FlowCyPy.signal_digitizer import SignalDigitizer
    from FlowCyPy.units import nanometer, millisecond, meter, micrometer, second, RIU, milliliter, particle, watt, megahertz, degree, ampere, milliwatt, AU








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-29

Step 2: Define the laser source
-------------------------------
Set up a laser source with a wavelength of 1550 nm, optical power of 200 mW, and a numerical aperture of 0.3.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-35

.. code-block:: Python

    source = GaussianBeam(
        numerical_aperture=0.3 * AU,  # Numerical aperture: 0.3
        wavelength=800 * nanometer,   # Laser wavelength: 800 nm
        optical_power=20 * milliwatt  # Optical power: 20 milliwatts
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-39

Step 3: Define flow parameters
------------------------------
Set the flow speed to 80 micrometers per second and a flow area of 1 square micrometer, with a total simulation time of 1 second.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 39-45

.. code-block:: Python

    flow_cell = FlowCell(
        source=source,
        flow_speed=7.56 * meter / second,        # Flow speed: 7.56 meters per second
        flow_area=(20 * micrometer) ** 2,        # Flow area: 10 x 10 micrometers
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 46-50

Step 4: Define the particle size distribution
---------------------------------------------
Use a normal size distribution with a mean size of 200 nanometers and a standard deviation of 10 nanometers.
This represents the population of scatterers (particles) that will interact with the laser source.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-122

.. code-block:: Python

    ev_size = distribution.Normal(
        mean=200 * nanometer,       # Mean particle size: 200 nanometers
        std_dev=10 * nanometer      # Standard deviation: 10 nanometers
    )

    ev_ri = distribution.Normal(
        mean=1.39 * RIU,    # Mean refractive index: 1.39
        std_dev=0.01 * RIU  # Standard deviation: 0.01
    )

    ev = Population(
        particle_count=1.8e+9 * particle / milliliter,
        size=ev_size,               # Particle size distribution
        refractive_index=ev_ri,     # Refractive index distribution
        name='EV'                   # Name of the particle population: Extracellular Vesicles (EV)
    )

    scatterer_collection = ScattererCollection()

    scatterer_collection.add_population(ev)


    # Step 5: Define the detector
    # ---------------------------
    # The detector captures the scattered light. It is positioned at 90 degrees relative to the incident light beam
    # and configured with a numerical aperture of 0.4 and responsitivity of 1.
    signal_digitizer = SignalDigitizer(
        bit_depth=1024,
        saturation_levels='auto',
        sampling_freq=1 * megahertz,        # Sampling frequency: 1 MHz
    )

    detector_0 = Detector(
        phi_angle=90 * degree,              # Detector angle: 90 degrees (Side Scatter)
        numerical_aperture=0.4 * AU,        # Numerical aperture of the detector
        name='first detector',              # Detector name
        responsitivity=1 * ampere / watt,   # Responsitivity of the detector (light to signal conversion efficiency)
        signal_digitizer=signal_digitizer
    )

    detector_1 = Detector(
        phi_angle=0 * degree,               # Detector angle: 90 degrees (Sid e Scatter)
        numerical_aperture=0.4 * AU,        # Numerical aperture of the detector
        name='second detector',             # Detector name
        responsitivity=1 * ampere / watt,   # Responsitivity of the detector (light to signal conversion efficiency)
        signal_digitizer=signal_digitizer
    )

    # Step 6: Simulate Flow Cytometer Signals
    # ---------------------------------------
    # Create a FlowCytometer instance to simulate the signals generated as particles pass through the laser beam.
    cytometer = FlowCytometer(
        scatterer_collection=scatterer_collection,
        flow_cell=flow_cell,                # Particle size distribution
        detectors=[detector_0, detector_1]  # List of detectors used in the simulation
    )

    # Run the flow cytometry simulation
    experiment = cytometer.get_continous_acquisition(run_time=0.2 * millisecond)

    # Visualize the scatter signals from both detectors
    experiment.plot.signals()

    experiment.logger.scatterer()
