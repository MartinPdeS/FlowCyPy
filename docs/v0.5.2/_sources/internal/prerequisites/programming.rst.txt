**Programming Skills**
----------------------

A solid grasp of programming concepts and tools is crucial for contributing to the development and validation of **FlowCyPy**.
Below, we highlight the essential skills and resources to enhance your proficiency.


.. _python-programming:

Python Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python is the backbone of **FlowCyPy**. You will need to work with advanced Python features and popular scientific libraries.
Key areas of focus include:

- Writing and understanding functions and classes, particularly within an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.
- Utilizing libraries such as ``numpy`` for numerical operations, ``matplotlib`` for visualization, and ``pandas`` for data manipulation.
- Debugging and troubleshooting Python scripts to identify and fix issues efficiently.

*Suggested Practice*: Enhance your skills with hands-on exercises available on `CodeChef Practice <https://www.codechef.com/practice>`_.

.. _git-and-version-control:

Git and Version Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version control is essential for collaborative software development.
You will use Git to manage the FlowCyPy codebase effectively. Familiarity with the following Git commands is expected:

- ``git clone``:  Clone repositories to your local machine for development.
- ``git pull``: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.
- ``git commit``: Save changes locally with descriptive commit messages.
- ``git push``: Upload your changes to the remote repository.
- ``git branch``: Create and manage branches for new features or experimental changes.
- ``git merge``: Integrate updates from different branches.
- ``git stash``: Temporarily save changes without committing them.

*Recommended Resource*: Master Git workflows through the `Pro Git Book <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>`_.
