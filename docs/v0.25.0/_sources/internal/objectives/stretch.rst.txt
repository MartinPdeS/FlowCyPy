Stretch Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Simulate complex particle distributions (e.g., a mixture of populations with varying refractive indices and sizes).
- Combine multiple noise sources to analyze their combined impact on detector signals.
- Extend **FlowCyPy** to simulate new detector configurations or optical setups.
- Design a new example showcasing advanced features, such as coincidence detection or real-time event analysis.

**Note**: These tasks aim to deepen your understanding of digital twins, simulation techniques, and flow cytometry, while contributing to the advancement of **FlowCyPy**.
