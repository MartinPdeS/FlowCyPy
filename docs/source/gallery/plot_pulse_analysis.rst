Analyzing Flow Cytometer Pulses
===============================

This script demonstrates how to analyze pulses generated by a flow cytometer using the
`PulseAnalyzer` class from the `FlowCyPy` library.

Flow cytometer pulses represent particles passing through a laser beam. By analyzing these pulses,
we can extract important features such as peak height, width, and area, which provide insights
into the properties of the particles.

Steps:
------
1. Create a synthetic signal representing pulses.
2. Analyze the signal using the `PulseAnalyzer` class.
3. Extract and display the pulse features.
4. Visualize the signal and the detected peaks.
