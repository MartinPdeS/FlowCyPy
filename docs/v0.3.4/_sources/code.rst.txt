Code Documentation
==================

This document provides the API documentation for the Flow Cytometer simulation package, which models
the flow of particles through a flow cytometer and generates particle arrival times based on a
Poisson process. The classes and functions documented here are automatically generated from the
codebase using Sphinx `autoclass` directives.
