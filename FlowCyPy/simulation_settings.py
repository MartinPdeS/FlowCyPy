class SimulationSettings(metaclass=RestrictiveMeta):
    """
    A singleton class to manage noise inclusion settings in simulations.

    This class provides a centralized configuration for enabling or disabling
    various noise components in a simulation. The class is implemented as a
    singleton, ensuring that only one instance exists throughout the application.

    The inclusion of noise components can be toggled globally through the
    `include_noises` attribute, which dynamically updates the individual noise
    settings.

    Attributes
    ----------
    include_noises : bool
        Whether to include noise components in simulations. If set to False,
        all individual noise settings are disabled.
    include_shot_noise : bool
        Whether to include shot noise in simulations. Default is True.
    include_dark_current_noise : bool
        Whether to include dark current noise in simulations. Default is True.
    include_amplifier_noise : bool
        Whether to include amplifier noise in simulations. Default is True.
    include_source_noise : bool
        Whether to include Relative Intensity Noise (RIN) in simulations. Default is True.
    assume_perfect_hydrodynamic_focusing: bool
        Whether to include the noise coming from the transversal sampling of
        the scatterer position regarding beam localization. Default is False.

    Methods
    -------
    __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        Ensures that only a single instance of the class is created (singleton pattern).

    include_noises (property):
        A getter and setter for the `include_noises` attribute that dynamically updates
        other noise settings.

    Notes
    -----
    - The class uses the `RestrictiveMeta` metaclass, preventing the addition of
      new class-level attributes after the class definition.
    - The singleton pattern is enforced by overriding the `__new__` method, ensuring
      a single shared instance.
