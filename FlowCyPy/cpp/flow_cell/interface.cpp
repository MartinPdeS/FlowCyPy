                Sample the transverse velocity profile of the flow cell.
                This method generates a list of tuples representing the transverse profile
                of the flow cell, where each tuple contains the y-coordinate, z-coordinate,
                and the corresponding velocity at that point.
                The coordinates are sampled uniformly within the flow cell's dimensions.
                The velocity is calculated based on the flow cell's parameters and the
                transverse position within the flow cell. The method returns a vector of tuples,
                where each tuple contains the y-coordinate, z-coordinate, and velocity at that point.
                The number of samples is specified by the `n_samples` parameter.
                The returned vector contains `n_samples` tuples, each representing a point in the transverse profile
                of the flow cell, with the y and z coordinates in meters and the velocity in m/s.

                using the analytical Fourier series solution for pressure-driven flow.

                The velocity profile is derived from solving the Stokes equation under the assumption of fully developed,
                incompressible, laminar flow with no-slip boundary conditions. The series solution is expressed as:

                .. math::

                u(y, z) = \frac{16 b^2}{\pi^3 \mu} \left( -\frac{dp}{dx} \right)
                \sum_{n=1,3,5,\ldots}^{\infty}
                \frac{1}{n^3}
                \left[
                    1 - \frac{
                        \cosh\left( \frac{n \pi y}{2b} \right)

                \right]
                \sin\left( \frac{n \pi (z + b)}{2b} \right)

                where:

                - \( a \) is half the channel width (in the y-direction)
                - \( b \) is half the channel height (in the z-direction)
                - \( \mu \) is the dynamic viscosity
                - \( \frac{dp}{dx} \) is the axial pressure gradient
                - \( n \) iterates over odd integers

                Parameters
                ----------
                y : float
                    Lateral (width-wise) position in meters.

                dpdx_local : float
