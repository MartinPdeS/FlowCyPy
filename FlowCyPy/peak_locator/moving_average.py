class SlidingWindowPeakLocator(BasePeakLocator):
    r"""
    SlidingWindowPeakLocator(window_size, window_step=-1, max_number_of_peaks=5, padding_value=-1,
                               compute_width=False, compute_area=False, threshold=0.5)

    A sliding-window-based peak detection utility for 1D signals. This class segments the input signal
    into fixed-size windows (which can be overlapping if window_step is less than window_size) and identifies
    the local maximum in each window. Optionally, it computes additional metrics for each peak:
    - Width: the number of contiguous samples above a specified fraction of the peak's height.
    - Area: the sum of signal values under the peak within its window.

    The results are returned as a dictionary containing fixed-length arrays. If fewer peaks are detected than
    max_number_of_peaks, the arrays are padded with padding_value (for indices) or NaN (for numeric values).

    Parameters
    ----------
    window_size : int
        The size of the sliding window used for local peak detection.
    window_step : int, optional
        The step size between consecutive windows. If not provided or set to -1, defaults to window_size
        (i.e., non-overlapping windows). To create overlapping windows, specify a value less than window_size.
    max_number_of_peaks : int, optional
        The maximum number of peaks to report. If fewer peaks are detected, the results are padded. Default is 5.
    padding_value : int, optional
        The value used to pad the output array for indices when fewer than max_number_of_peaks peaks are found.
        Default is -1.
    compute_width : bool, optional
        If True, compute and return the width of each detected peak (in samples). Default is False.
    compute_area : bool, optional
        If True, compute and return the area (sum of signal values) under each detected peak. Default is False.
    threshold : float, optional
        The fraction of the peak's height used to determine the boundaries for width and area calculations.
        For example, a threshold of 0.5 uses 50% of the peak height as the cutoff. Default is 0.5.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary containing the following keys:
          - "Index": A fixed-length array of detected peak indices, padded as necessary.
          - "Height": A fixed-length array of the corresponding peak values.
          - "Width": (optional) A fixed-length array of computed peak widths (if compute_width is True).
          - "Area": (optional) A fixed-length array of computed peak areas (if compute_area is True).
