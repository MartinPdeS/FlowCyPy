Flow Cytometry Setup
====================

Requirements
------------

### 1. **Breadboard Design**
- Large breadboard with a central hole to allow flow cell and tubing integration.
- Stable and vibration-resistant material.

### 2. **System Flexibility**
- Modular and reconfigurable components.
- Kinematic mounts for precise alignment.

### 3. **Optical Source**
- Flat-top Gaussian beam profile.
- Adjustable spot size with a zoom beam expander.
- Option for asymmetric flat-top profiles with different sizes in X and Y directions:
  - Cylindrical lenses or mirrors for independent control of each axis.
  - Diffractive optical elements (DOEs) for custom shaping.
  - Spatial light modulators (SLMs) for dynamic and precise adjustments.

#### Additional Options for Flat-Top Generation:
- **Multimode Fiber (MMF):**
  - Beam homogenization through modal dispersion.
  - Compact and flexible for integration.
  - Requires precise input coupling and output shaping for uniform profiles.

- **Aperture-Based Shaping:**
  - Use of apertures or masks to trim beam edges for a pseudo-flat-top profile.
  - Simple and cost-effective but less efficient.

- **Microlens Arrays:**
  - Arrays of microlenses can redistribute intensity to create a uniform flat-top profile.
  - Highly efficient and compact.
  - Suitable for creating symmetric or asymmetric beam profiles depending on lens design.

### 4. **Optical Design**
- Beam quality specifications (laser wavelength, power, polarization stability).
- Alignment aids like telescopes or pointers.
- Flexible detection optics (e.g., swappable filters and compatible detectors).

### 5. **Mechanical and Environmental Considerations**
- Environmental isolation and vibration damping.
- Space for future upgrades or additional components.

### 6. **Safety and Maintenance**
- Laser safety features like shutters and interlocks.
- Ease of maintenance with accessible components.
